    <h2 class="about">
      The hospital serves as a regional referral and teaching hospital providing
      the highest level of care for women and infants, and trauma and cardiac
      patients. Inside our remodeled state of the art facility, our renowned
      medical professionals use the latest technologies to provide unparalleled
      care with compassion. Our Imaging Center features advanced imaging
      technology, including the latest digital mammography, MRI, digital
      radiology, ultrasound, and dual energy Xray equipment. The Cristie Kerr
      Women’s Health Center and the Women’s Health Center at 116 Newark Avenue
      (at Grove Street) offer women convenient access to the highest level of
      medical care. Together, they represent a leap forward in Hudson County
      health services. Jersey City Medical Center is the provider of Advanced
      Life Support for Hudson County. JCMC is a Regional Trauma Center, a Level
      III Regional Neonatal Intensive Care Center, and a Regional Heart Hospital
      with cardiac surgery.<br /><br />
      Our hospital is the only three-time Magnet‐Designated Hospital for Nursing
      Excellence in Hudson, Union, or Essex counties. In 2015, Jersey City
      Medical Center invested in the health care needs of Jersey City with the
      renovation of the Greenville Hospital facility on Kennedy Boulevard as an
      outpatient medical center. Now, along with RWJBarnabas Health, Jersey City
      Medical Center remains steadfast in its commitment to provide for the
      needs of Greenville and all of Hudson County with a unique array of
      services intended to enhance care for families who need it most. Jersey
      City Medical Center provides 24/7 emergency services at RWJBarnabas Health
      at Bayonne. This fully‐licensed emergency department has all the same
      capabilities as a traditional emergency room, staffed with board‐certified
      emergency room physicians, specially‐trained nurses, technicians and
      health care professionals.<br /><br />
      Doctors/staff can give more time to patients rather than focusing on
      management which will increase the efficiency thus eventually increasing
      the brand value of the hospital. In times of calamity(eg covid) the
      problem of beds will not be faced and thus patients will receive easy and
      better treatment.
