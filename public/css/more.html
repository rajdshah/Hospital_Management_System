    <h2>1) What is Hepatitis A?</h2>
    <p>Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause inflammation and affect your liver's ability to function.<br>
        You're most likely to get hepatitis A from contaminated food or water or from close contact with a person or object that's infected. Mild cases of hepatitis A don't require treatment. Most people who are infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
    <p>Hepatitis A signs and symptoms typically don't appear until you've had the virus for a few weeks. But not everyone with hepatitis A develops them. If you do, hepatitis signs and symptoms can include:

        Fatigue
        Sudden nausea and vomiting
        Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially on the upper right side beneath your lower ribs (by your liver)
        Clay-colored bowel movements
        Loss of appetite
        Low-grade fever
        Dark urine
        Joint pain
        Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
        Intense itching</p>

    <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
    <p>If you're traveling to parts of the world where hepatitis A outbreaks occur, take these steps to prevent infection:

        Peel and wash all fresh fruits and vegetables yourself.
        Don't eat raw or undercooked meat and fish.
        Drink bottled water and use it when brushing your teeth.
        Avoid all beverages of unknown purity, with or without ice.
        If bottled water isn't available, boil tap water before drinking it.
        
        Thoroughly wash your hands often, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper and before preparing food or eating.
    </p>   <br>
    <h2>2) What is Hepatitis B?</h2>
    <p>Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). For some people, hepatitis B infection becomes chronic, meaning it lasts more than six months. Having chronic hepatitis B increases your risk of developing liver failure, liver cancer or cirrhosis — a condition that permanently scars of the liver.

        Most adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their signs and symptoms are severe. Infants and children are more likely to develop a chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis B infection.
        
        A vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, but there's no cure if you have the condition. If you're infected, taking certain precautions can help prevent spreading the virus to others.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
    <p>Signs and symptoms of hepatitis B range from mild to severe. They usually appear about one to four months after you've been infected, although you could see them as early as two weeks post-infection. Some people, usually young children, may not have any symptoms.

        Hepatitis B signs and symptoms may include:
        
        Abdominal pain
        Dark urine
        Fever
        Joint pain
        Loss of appetite
        Nausea and vomiting
        Weakness and fatigue
        Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)</p>

        <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
        <p>Know the HBV status of any sexual partner. Don't engage in unprotected sex unless you're absolutely certain your partner isn't infected with HBV or any other sexually transmitted infection.
            Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex if you don't know the health status of your partner. Remember that although condoms can reduce your risk of contracting HBV, they don't eliminate the risk.
            Don't use illegal drugs. If you use illicit drugs, get help to stop. If you can't stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject illicit drugs. Never share needles.
            Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing. If you get a piercing or tattoo, look for a reputable shop. Ask about how the equipment is cleaned. Make sure the employees use sterile needles. If you can't get answers, look for another shop.
            Ask about the hepatitis B vaccine before you travel. If you're traveling to a region where hepatitis B is common, ask your doctor about the hepatitis B vaccine in advance. It's usually given in a series of three injections over a six-month period.
        </p>    <br>
        <h2>3) What is Hepatitis C?</h2>
        <p>Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious liver damage. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contaminated blood.
    
            Until recently, hepatitis C treatment required weekly injections and oral medications that many HCV-infected people couldn't take because of other health problems or unacceptable side effects.</p>
    
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
        <p>Long-term infection with the hepatitis C virus is known as chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C is usually a "silent" infection for many years, until the virus damages the liver enough to cause the signs and symptoms of liver disease.
    
            Signs and symptoms include:
            
            Bleeding easily
            Bruising easily
            Fatigue
            Poor appetite
            Yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
            Dark-colored urine
            Itchy skin
            Fluid buildup in your abdomen (ascites)
            Swelling in your legs
            Weight loss
            Confusion, drowsiness and slurred speech (hepatic encephalopathy)
            Spiderlike blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas)</p>
    
            <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
            <p>Protect yourself from hepatitis C infection by taking the following precautions:
    
                Stop using illicit drugs, particularly if you inject them. If you use illicit drugs, seek help.
                Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing. If you choose to undergo piercing or tattooing, look for a reputable shop. Ask questions beforehand about how the equipment is cleaned. Make sure the employees use sterile needles. If employees won't answer your questions, look for another shop.
                Practice safer sex. Don't engage in unprotected sex with multiple partners or with any partner whose health status is uncertain. Sexual transmission between monogamous couples may occur, but the risk is low.
            </p>    <br>
            <h2>4) What is Hepatitis E?</h2>
<p>Hepatitis E is a virus that infects your liver. It can cause your liver to swell up.

    Most people with hepatitis E get better within a few months. Usually it doesn’t lead to long-term illness or liver damage like some other forms of hepatitis do. But hepatitis E can be dangerous for pregnant women or anyone with weak immune systems, including the elderly or people who are ill.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>    
<p>You might not have any. If you do have symptoms, they may start anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks after your infection. They may include:

    Mild fever
    Feeling very tired
    Less hunger
    Feeling sick to your stomach
    Throwing up
    Belly pain
    Dark pee
    Light-colored poop
    Skin rash or itching
    Joint pain
    Yellowish skin or eyes</p>

    <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
    <p>No vaccine can prevent the hepatitis E virus. It’s most common in less-developed countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central America. You can lower your chances of getting the virus if you:

        Don’t drink water or use ice that you don’t know is clean.
        Don’t eat undercooked pork, deer meat, or raw shellfish.
        Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the bathroom, change a diaper, and before you prepare or eat food.
    </p>    <br>
    <h2>5) What is Palliative Care?</h2>
    <p>Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing patients relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness, no matter the diagnosis or stage of disease. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for both patients and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving.

        Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained people. They work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care.</p>

    <h3>Why it's done?</h3>    
    <p>Palliative care may be offered to people of any age who have a serious or life-threatening illness. It can help adults and children living with illnesses such as:

        Cancer
        Blood and bone marrow disorders requiring stem cell transplant
        Heart disease
        Cystic fibrosis
        Dementia
        End-stage liver disease
        Kidney failure
        Lung disease
        Parkinson's disease
        Stroke
        Symptoms that may be improved by palliative care include:
        
        Pain
        Nausea or vomiting
        Anxiety or nervousness
        Depression or sadness
        Constipation
        Difficulty breathing
        Anorexia
        Fatigue
        Trouble sleeping</p>

        <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
        <p>To prevent re-infestation and to prevent the mites from spreading to other people, take these steps:

            Clean all clothes and linen. Use hot, soapy water to wash all clothing, towels and bedding used within three days before beginning treatment. Dry with high heat. Dry-clean items you can't wash at home.
            Starve the mites. Consider placing items you can't wash in a sealed plastic bag and leaving it in an out-of-the-way place, such as in your garage, for a couple of weeks. Mites die after a few days without food.
        </p>    <br>
    <h2>6) What is Scabies?</h2>
    <p>Scabies is an itchy skin condition caused by a tiny burrowing mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. Intense itching occurs in the area where the mite burrows. The urge to scratch may be especially strong at night.

        Scabies is contagious and can spread quickly through close physical contact in a family, child care group, school class, nursing home or prison. Because scabies is so contagious, doctors often recommend treatment for entire families or contact groups.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
    <p>Scabies signs and symptoms include:

        Itching, often severe and usually worse at night
        Thin, irregular burrow tracks made up of tiny blisters or bumps on your skin
        The burrows or tracks typically appear in folds of skin. Though almost any part of the body may be involved, in adults and older children scabies is most often found:
        
        Between the fingers
        In the armpits
        Around the waist
        Along the insides of the wrists
        On the inner elbows
        On the soles of the feet
        Around the breasts
        Around the male genital area
        On the buttocks
        On the knees
        In infants and young children, common sites of infestation usually include the:
        
        Scalp
        Palms of the hands
        Soles of the feet</p>

        <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
        <p>To prevent re-infestation and to prevent the mites from spreading to other people, take these steps:

            Clean all clothes and linen. Use hot, soapy water to wash all clothing, towels and bedding used within three days before beginning treatment. Dry with high heat. Dry-clean items you can't wash at home.
            Starve the mites. Consider placing items you can't wash in a sealed plastic bag and leaving it in an out-of-the-way place, such as in your garage, for a couple of weeks. Mites die after a few days without food.
        </p>    <br>
        <h2>7) What is Scarlet Fever?</h2>
        <p>Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that develops in some people who have strep throat. Also known as scarlatina, scarlet fever features a bright red rash that covers most of the body. Scarlet fever is almost always accompanied by a sore throat and a high fever.
    
            Scarlet fever is most common in children 5 to 15 years of age. Although scarlet fever was once considered a serious childhood illness, antibiotic treatments have made it less threatening. Still, if left untreated, scarlet fever can result in more-serious conditions that affect the heart, kidneys and other parts of the body.</p>
    
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
        <p>The signs and symptoms that give scarlet fever its name include:
    
            Red rash. The rash looks like a sunburn and feels like sandpaper. It typically begins on the face or neck and spreads to the trunk, arms and legs. If pressure is applied to the reddened skin, it will turn pale.
            Red lines. The folds of skin around the groin, armpits, elbows, knees and neck usually become a deeper red than the surrounding rash.
            Flushed face. The face may appear flushed with a pale ring around the mouth.
            Strawberry tongue. The tongue generally looks red and bumpy, and it's often covered with a white coating early in the disease.
            The rash and the redness in the face and tongue usually last about a week. After these signs and symptoms have subsided, the skin affected by the rash often peels. Other signs and symptoms associated with scarlet fever include:
            
            Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or higher, often with chills
            Very sore and red throat, sometimes with white or yellowish patches
            Difficulty swallowing
            Enlarged glands in the neck (lymph nodes) that are tender to the touch
            Nausea or vomiting
            Headache</p>
    
            <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
            <p>There is no vaccine to prevent scarlet fever. The best prevention strategies for scarlet fever are the same as the standard precautions against infections:
    
                Wash your hands. Show your child how to wash his or her hands thoroughly with warm soapy water.
                Don't share dining utensils or food. As a rule, your child shouldn't share drinking glasses or eating utensils with friends or classmates. This rule applies to sharing food, too.
                Cover your mouth and nose. Tell your child to cover his or her mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing to prevent the potential spread of germs.
            </p> <br>
            <h2>8) What is Adenovirus?</h2>
    <p>Adenoviruses are a group of common viruses that infect the lining of your eyes, airways and lungs, intestines, urinary tract, and nervous system. They're common causes of fever, coughs, sore throats, diarrhea, and pink eye.

        Infections happen in children more often than in adults, but anyone can get them. Most kids will have at least one type of adenovirus infection by the time they’re 10.
        
        The infections usually cause only mild symptoms and get better on their own in a few days. But they can be more serious in people with weak immune systems, especially children.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
    <p>Each type of adenovirus can affect you differently:

        Bronchitis: Cough, runny nose, fever, chills
        Colds and other respiratory infections: Stuffy and runny nose, cough, sore throat, and swollen glands
        Croup: Barking cough, trouble breathing, high-pitched sound when breathing in
        Ear infection: Ear pain, irritability, fever
        Pink eye (conjunctivitis): Red eyes, discharge from your eyes, tearing, feeling like there's something in your eye
        Pneumonia: Fever, cough, trouble breathing
        Stomach and intestinal infections: Diarrhea, vomiting, headache, fever, stomach cramps
        Swelling of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis and encephalitis): Headache, fever, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting (this is rare)
        Urinary tract infections: Burning and pain while urinating, frequent need to go, blood in your urine</p>

        <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
        <p>To help keep your child from getting sick:

            Try to keep your child away from anyone you know is sick.
            Wash your child's hands -- and yours -- often during the day, and especially before meals. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you don't have soap and water nearby.
            Clean surfaces, like sinks and counters, to get rid of germs.
            Don't let them swim in pools that aren't well maintained.
            Keep your child home when they're sick to avoid spreading adenoviruses to others. Tell them to cover their nose and mouth whenever they sneeze or cough.
        </p>    <br>
        <h2>9) What is Campylobacter?</h2>
    <p>Campylobacter is 1 of 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases. It is considered to be the most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the world.
        Campylobacter infections are generally mild, but can be fatal among very young children, elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals.
        Campylobacter species can be killed by heat and thoroughly cooking food.
        To prevent Campylobacter infections, make sure to follow basic food hygiene practices when preparing food.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
    <p>Campylobacteriosis is the disease caused by the infection with Campylobacter:

        The onset of disease symptoms usually occurs 2 to 5 days after infection with the bacteria, but can range from 1 to 10 days.
        The most common clinical symptoms of Campylobacter infections include diarrhoea (frequently bloody), abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. The symptoms typically last 3 to 6 days.
        Death from campylobacteriosis is rare and is usually confined to very young children or elderly patients, or to those already suffering from another serious disease such as AIDS.
        Complications such as bacteraemia (presence of bacteria in the blood), hepatitis, pancreatitis (infections of liver and pancreas, respectively), and miscarriage have been reported with various degrees of frequency. 
        Post-infection complications may include reactive arthritis (painful inflammation of the joints which can last for several months) and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a polio-like form of paralysis that can result in respiratory and severe neurological dysfunction in a small number of cases.</p>

        <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
        <p>There are a number of strategies that can be used to prevent disease from Campylobacter:

            Prevention is based on control measures at all stages of the food chain, from agricultural production on a farm, to processing, manufacturing and preparation of foods both commercially and domestically.
            In countries without adequate sewage disposal systems, faeces and articles soiled with faeces may need to be disinfected before disposal.
            Measures to reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter in poultry include enhanced biosecurity to avoid transmission of Campylobacter from the environment to the flock of birds on the farm. This control option is feasible only where birds are kept in closed housing conditions.
            Good hygienic slaughtering practices reduce the contamination of carcasses by faeces, but will not guarantee the absence of Campylobacter from meat and meat products. Training in hygienic food handling for abattoir workers and raw meat producers is essential to keep contamination to a minimum.
            Prevention methods against infection in domestic kitchens are similar to those used against other foodborne bacterial diseases.
            Bactericidal treatment, such as heating (for example, cooking or pasteurization) or irradiation, is the only effective method of eliminating Campylobacter from contaminated foods.
        </p>    <br>
        <h2>10) What is Cryptococcus?</h2>
    <p>Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that lives in the environment throughout the world. People can become infected with C. neoformans after breathing in the microscopic fungus, although most people who are exposed to the fungus never get sick from it. C. neoformans infections are rare in people who are otherwise healthy; most cases occur in people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those who have advanced HIV/AIDS.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>    
    <p>A C. neoformans infection in the lungs can cause a pneumonia-like illness. The symptoms are often similar to those of many other illnesses, and can include:

        Cough
        Shortness of breath
        Chest pain
        Fever
   
        Cryptococcal meningitis is an infection caused by the fungus Cryptococcus after it spreads from the lungs to the brain. The symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis include:

        Headache
        Fever
        Neck pain
        Nausea and vomiting
        Sensitivity to light
        Confusion or changes in behavior
    </p>

        <h3>Safety Measures</h3> 
        <p>It’s difficult to avoid breathing in C. neoformans because it’s thought to be common in the environment. Most people who breathe in C. neoformans never get sick from it. However, in people who have weakened immune systems, C. neoformans can stay hidden in the body and cause infection later when the immune system becomes too weak to fight it off. This leaves a window of time when the silent infection can be detected and treated early, before symptoms develop (see “Detecting silent cryptococcal infection in people who have HIV/AIDS”).
